<br>
<p>Bamazon, an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL, is a command-line application that takes orders from the user (customer) and reduces the storefront's stock when the user (customer) completes a purchase.</p>
<br>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To use the Bamazon application, simply clone the repository, and then open your terminal application to the directory the cloned repository is located. To start the application, type <strong>node bamazonCustomer</strong> and then choose from the items (products) that are displayed. Once you've chosen an item (product) and pressed 'enter', the user (customer) will enter the number of units they would like to purchase. If there are enough units in stock, the user will be directed to the checkout and the total price of the item will be displayed. If there are not enough of the item (product) in stock, the user (customer) will be informed, 'not enough in stock, please choose another amount' and will be redirected back to the item (product) list.

Or for a screen capture of the terminal, navigate to <a href="#" rel="nofollow"><strong>Bamazon Screen Capture.</strong></a></p>
